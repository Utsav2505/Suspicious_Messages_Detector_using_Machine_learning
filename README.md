# Suspicious Message Detector

Welcome to the Suspicious Message Detector project! This tool is designed to help you identify potential suspicious messages in your text data. It can be particularly useful for tasks like spam detection, phishing email identification, or monitoring online conversations.

## About the Project

The Suspicious Message Detector is built using advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. It analyzes the content of a given message and assigns a suspicion score based on various factors such as the presence of suspicious keywords, unusual patterns, or inconsistencies in the text.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Suspicious Message Detector project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. **Data Preparation**: The project requires a text file containing the messages you want to analyze. Create a new text file named `messages.txt` and add your messages to it. Make sure each message is on a new line.
2. **Running the Program**: Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt to run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
The program will process the messages in the `messages.txt` file and display the suspicion scores for each message.

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be entering a message on the input bar and the program will output whether that message is suspicious or not. Messages categorised as suspicious are most likely to be suspicious and require further investigation.

You can also customize the project by adjusting the parameters in the `config.py` file. This allows you to fine-tune the suspicious message detection process based on your specific needs.

## Examples

The project includes two example images (`example_suspicious_message.png` and `example_non_suspicious_message.png`) to help you understand the purpose of the project better. These images show examples of suspicious and non-suspicious messages, which can be used as a reference when analyzing your own text data.
